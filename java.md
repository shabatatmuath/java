# JavaScript 

 JS is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

 ## Script

 A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal .To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. so start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically. Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations.


## Expression

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking , there are two types of expressions: 
+ EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE LIKE "var color = 'beige';"
+ EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE 

 ## Functions

 A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value. 
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements.
